This repository showcases three AI projects I completed as part of my learning journey. Each project demonstrates different aspects of artificial intelligence, from natural language processing to computer vision.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

I implemented a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Using if-else statements and pattern matching techniques, I identified user queries and provided appropriate responses. This task helped me gain a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

I developed an AI agent capable of playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Leveraging algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, I ensured the AI player was unbeatable. This project deepened my understanding of game theory and basic search algorithms.

### Task 3: Face Detection and Recognition

I created an AI application capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos. I utilized pre-trained face detection models such as Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors. Additionally, I optionally incorporated face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace. This task enhanced my skills in computer vision and deep learning techniques.
